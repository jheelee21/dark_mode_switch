This is a macOS shell script that automatically switches between dark and light modes based on whether an external monitor is connected. 
The script runs in the background and uses system commands to detect when a monitor is attached or detached. 
When it detects a change, it immediately switches the system appearance: dark mode when an external monitor is connected, and light mode when it's disconnected. 
This automation enhances user experience by adjusting the display mode to suit different work environments without manual intervention.
